Inspired by Dean Oliver's "Basketball on Paper"-- a D3 visualization of player usage

A personal project intended for practice on data scraping using regex and visualization using D3.js. Due to technical issues 2018 data could not be salvaged but I will (hopefully) work on fixing it (in the distant future).
